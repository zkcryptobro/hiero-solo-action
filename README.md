# hiero-solo-action

A GitHub Action for setting up a Hiero Solo network.
An overview of the usage and idea of the action can be found [here](https://dev.to/hendrikebbers/ci-for-hedera-based-projects-2nja).

The network that is created by the action contains one consensus node that can be accessed at `localhost:50211`.
The action creates an account on the network that contains 10,000,000 hbars.
All information about the account is stored as output to the github action.

A good example on how the action is used can be found at the [hiero-enterprise project action]([https://github.com/OpenElements/hedera-enterprise/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml](https://github.com/OpenElements/hiero-enterprise-java/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml)). Here the action is used to create a temporary network that is than used to execute tests against the network.

## Inputs

The GitHub action takes the following inputs:

# Tributes

This action is based on the work of [Hiero Solo](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/solo).
Without the great help of [Timo](https://github.com/timo0), [Nathan](https://github.com/nathanklick), and [Lenin](https://github.com/leninmehedy) this action would not exist.
